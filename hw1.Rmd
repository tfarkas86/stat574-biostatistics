# Problem 1. (see also problems 1-3 of chapter 2 on the book)

For the following problems, state each model statistically, identifying
each predictor with one or more component variables. Identify and
interpret each regression parameter except for coefficients of nonlinear
terms in spline functions. State each hypothesis below as a formal
statistical hypothesis involving the proper parameters, and give the
(numerator) degrees of freedom of the test. State alternative hypotheses
carefully with respect to unions or intersections of conditions and list
the type of alternatives to the null hypothesis that the test is
designed to detect.

Questions: What is meant by identifying each predictor with one or more
component variables? Dummy variables?

-   **1a.** (1 point) A property of $Y$ such as the mean is linear in
    age and blood pressure and there may be an interaction between the
    two predictors. Test $H_0$ : there is no interaction between age and
    blood pressure. Also test $H_0$ : blood pressure is not associated
    with $Y$ (in any fashion). State the effect of blood pressure as a
    function of age, and the effect of age as a function of blood
    pressure.

a.  The statistical model is:\
    $$C(Y|age, BP) = \beta_0 + \beta_1age + \beta_2BP + \beta_3(age \times BP)$$

b.  $\beta_0$, the intercept term, represents the value of the property
    of Y when both age and blood pressure are zero:
    $C(Y|age = 0, BP = 0)$.

c.  $\beta_1$ is the parameter for the main effect of age. In the
    context of a model in which age interacts with blood pressure, this
    represents the amount by which $C(Y|BP = 0)$ increases per unit
    increase in age, likely per year. Notice an estimate of this
    parameter regards a population with zero blood pressure -- not
    likely a population in which we are interested.

d.  $\beta_2$ is the parameter for the main effect of blood pressure. In
    the context of a model in which age interacts with blood pressure,
    this represents the amount by which $C(Y|age = 0)$ increases per
    unit increase in blood. Notice an estimate of this parameter regards
    the populations of newborns only.

e.  $\beta_3$ is the parameter for the interaction between age and blood
    pressure. This represents the non-additive, combined effect of age
    and blood pressure $C(Y)$. Hence, its value denotes the change in
    effect of age on $C(Y)$ per unit increase in blood pressure. Or,
    equivalently, the change in effect of blood pressure per unit
    increase in age.

f.  To test the hypothesis of an interaction between age and blood
    pressure, test\
    $$H_0: \beta_3 = 0$$ $$H_\alpha: \beta_3 \ne 0$$

g.  To test the hypothesis that blood pressure is associated with
    $C(Y)$, test $$H_0: \beta_2 = \beta_3 = 0$$ $$H_\alpha: otherwise$$

h.  The effect of blood pressure as a function of age =
    $\beta_2 + \beta_3age$

i.  The effect of age as a function of blood pressure =
    $\beta_1 + \beta_3BP$

-   **1b.** (1 point) Consider a linear additive model involving three
    treatments (control, drug $Z$, and drug $Q$) and one continuous
    adjustment variable, age. Test $H_0$ : treatment group is not
    associated with response, adjusted for age. Also test $H_0$ :
    response for drug $Z$ has the same property as the response for drug
    $Q$, adjusted for age.

a.  The statistical model is:\
    $$C(Y|X_1, X_2, X_3) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \beta_3X_3$$
    where $X_1$ is the continuous covariate, and $X_2, X_3$ are dummy
    variables representing the treatment:

    +----------------------------+----------+------------+------------+
    | Dummy Variable             | Control  | Drug Z     | Drug Q     |
    +============================+==========+============+============+
    | $X_2$                      | 0        | 1          | 0          |
    +----------------------------+----------+------------+------------+
    | $X_3$                      | 0        | 0          | 1          |
    +----------------------------+----------+------------+------------+

b.  $\beta_0$, the intercept term, represents the value of the property
    of Y when the patients are in the control group and the continuous
    covariate is zero: $C(Y|X_1 = 0, TMNT = control)$

c.  $\beta_1$ is the parameter for the effect of the continuous covariate. It is the amoung by which $C(Y)$ increases per unit increase in $X_1$. 

# TODO: start here

d.  $\beta_2$ is the parameter for the main effect of blood pressure. In
    the context of a model in which age interacts with blood pressure,
    this represents the amount by which $C(Y|age = 0)$ increases per
    unit increase in blood. Notice an estimate of this parameter regards
    the populations of newborns only.

-   **1c.** Consider models each with two predictors, temperature and
    white blood count (WBC), for which temperature is always assumed to
    be linearly related to the appropriate property of the response, and
    WBC may or may not be linear (depending on the particular model you
    formulate for each question). Test:

    -   (1 point) **i.** $H_0$: WBC is not associated with the response
        versus $H_a$ : WBC is linearly associated with the property of
        the response.
    -   (1 point) **ii.** $H_0$: WBC is not associated with $Y$ versus
        $H_a$: WBC is quadratically associated with $Y$. Also write down
        the formal test of linearity against this quadratic alternative.
    -   (1 point) **iii.** $H_0$: WBC is not associated with $Y$ versus
        $H_a$: WBC related to the property of the response through a
        smooth spline function; for example, for WBC the model requires
        the variables WBC, WBC', and WBC'' where WBC' and WBC''
        represent nonlinear components (if there are four knots in a
        restricted cubic spline function). Also write down the formal
        test of linearity against this spline function alternative.
    -   (1 point) **iv.** Test for a lack of fit (combined nonlinearity
        or non-additivity) in an overall model that takes the form of an
        interaction between temperature and WBC, allowing WBC to be
        modeled with a smooth spline function.
